# ESP32Weatherstation

This project uses an ESP32 to collect time and weatherdata for an ESP32. Make sure to setup your Arduino IDE beforehand, so it can handle ESP32.

Also you will need the TFT_eSPI library. This library needs to be setup correctly via the User_Setup.h file. You will also need a working WLAN and an openweathermap account. These details need to be added to the weatherGitArduino.ino file.

For more details, have a look at jsneidhart.de/weatherArduinoSetup.htm.
